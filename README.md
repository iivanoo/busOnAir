University of L'Aquila - Computer Science Department
=============


This is a fork of the [Transport Dublin][6] project.


We are working on extending it with:

- real-time tracking of the vehicles on the network
- a set of mobile applications that can seamlessly access the service from either iOs, Android, or Windows devices
- a set of optimization algorithms that will help engineers in studying and enhancing the overall network performance

We are applying the project to a real case study on the public transportation system of L'Aquila (Italy).
